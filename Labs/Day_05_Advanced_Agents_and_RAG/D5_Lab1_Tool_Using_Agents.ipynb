    "# Day 5 - Lab 1: Tool-Using Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Build agents that can use external tools to accomplish tasks they cannot perform on their own, using both LangChain and custom Python functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated Time:** 135 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "Welcome to Day 5! We are now shifting from using AI to build a traditional application to building applications that *are* AI. An 'agent' is more than just a prompt; it's a system that can reason, plan, and use tools to achieve a goal. In this lab, you will build your first simple agents using the flexible LangChain framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "For definitions of key terms used in this lab, please refer to the [GLOSSARY.md](../../GLOSSARY.md)."

    "## Step 1: Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We will set up our environment, which for today includes installing the `langchain`, `langchain-community`, and `tavily-python` libraries. Tavily is a search engine API optimized for AI agents, which we will use as our first tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Selection:**\n",
    "For agentic tasks that require reasoning and tool use, highly capable models are recommended. `gpt-4.1`, `o3`, `gemini-2.5-pro`, or open-source models like `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1` are excellent choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Helper Functions Used:**\n",
    "- `setup_llm_client()`: To configure the API client.\n",
    "- `get_completion()`: To send prompts to the LLM (though we'll mostly use LangChain's abstractions)."

    "### Challenge 1 (Foundational): Building a LangChain Agent with One Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:** Build a simple LangChain agent that can use the Tavily Search API to answer questions about current events.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "1.  Import `TavilySearchResults` from `langchain_community.tools.tavily_search`.\n",
    "2.  Import `create_tool_calling_agent` and `AgentExecutor` from `langchain.agents`.\n",
    "3.  Import `ChatPromptTemplate` from `langchain_core.prompts`.\n",
    "4.  Instantiate the `TavilySearchResults` tool.\n",
    "5.  Create a prompt template. It must include a placeholder for `agent_scratchpad`.\n",
    "6.  Create the agent by passing the LLM, the list of tools, and the prompt to `create_tool_calling_agent`.\n",
    "7.  Create an `AgentExecutor` to run the agent.\n",
    "8.  Invoke the agent with a question that requires a web search, like \"What was the score of the last Super Bowl?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Quality:** The agent should successfully use the Tavily tool to search the web, find the correct information, and provide an accurate answer."

    "3.  Create a new list of tools that includes both the search tool and your new calculator tool.\n",
