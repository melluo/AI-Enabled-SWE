This requires the agent to make multiple, distinct calls to its tool to gather all the necessary information before synthesizing a final answer."

    "How does an agent actually \"use\" a tool? Most modern agents follow a pattern called **ReAct**, which stands for **Reason-Act**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you give the agent a complex task, it enters a loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Reason (Thought):** The agent first thinks about the overall goal and its available tools. It breaks the problem down and decides on a single, concrete action it can take *right now*. For example: `\"The user needs flight options. I should use the search tool to find flights from JFK to CDG.\"`\n",
    "2.  **Act:** The agent executes the chosen action. This means calling the tool (e.g., `TavilySearchResults(query='flights from JFK to CDG')`).\n",
    "3.  **Observe:** The agent gets the result (the \"observation\") back from the tool (e.g., a list of flight search results).\n",
    "4.  **Repeat:** The agent takes this new information, re-evaluates the overall goal, and enters the **Reason** step again. `\"Okay, I have the flights. Now the user needs tourist activities. I should use the search tool again to find activities in Paris.\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "This **Thought -> Action -> Observation** loop continues until the agent has gathered enough information to formulate a final answer. When you set `verbose=True` in a LangChain `AgentExecutor`, you are watching this ReAct loop happen in real-time!"

This lab reinforces how agents can break down a complex query into smaller, manageable steps, use their tools to gather information for each step, and then synthesize the results into a comprehensive final answer. You also learned about the underlying ReAct framework that powers this agentic behavior."
