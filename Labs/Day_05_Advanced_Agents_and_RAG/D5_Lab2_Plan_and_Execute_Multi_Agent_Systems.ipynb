    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Explore advanced agent architectures, including the plan-and-execute model and conversational multi-agent systems using Microsoft's AutoGen.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated Time:** 135 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "In the previous lab, you built agents that could use tools. Now, we will explore how to orchestrate more complex agent behaviors. First, you will build a \"plan-and-execute\" agent that first thinks about a problem and then writes the code. Second, you will use the AutoGen framework to create a team of AI agents that can collaborate on a task through conversation.\n",

    "### Challenge 1 (Foundational): A Plan-and-Execute Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:** Create a two-step agent that first generates a detailed plan (a 'spec') for a Python function and then uses that plan to write the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Hint:** The 'Plan-and-Execute' pattern separates thinking from doing. The first agent (the Planner) creates a detailed blueprint. The second agent (the Coder) is given a much simpler task: just follow the blueprint. This separation often leads to more reliable and accurate results than asking a single agent to do everything at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "1.  Define a high-level goal, such as: \"Create a Python function that takes a list of strings and returns a new list containing only the strings that are palindromes.\"\n",
    "2.  **Planner Agent:** Write a prompt that asks the LLM to act as a senior software architect. It should take the high-level goal and produce a detailed specification for the function, including the function signature, parameters, return value, and step-by-step logic.\n",
    "3.  **Coder Agent:** Write a second prompt. This prompt should take the detailed specification from the Planner Agent as its *only* context and instruct the LLM to write the Python code that implements the spec.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Quality:** A two-stage generation process that separates the 'planning' from the 'doing', resulting in a well-defined Python function."

      "- Strong use of type hints, pydantic models.\n",
      "- Response model matches expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Suggestions**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Only Suggest Improvements When Needed:**\n",
      "   - Per requirements, summary should only appear if not “Strong.” Your code includes `\"Very Strong\"` as well. If by spec, “Very Strong” doesn’t need suggestions, adjust the condition:\n",
      "\n",

      "   if complexity_label != \"Strong\":\n",
      "       ...\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Regex Efficiency:**\n",
      "   - For long passwords, using `str.any()` may be slightly faster and more readable:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   has_uppercase = any(c.isupper() for c in password)\n",

      "   ```\n",
      "   It’s a minor optimization, but avoids regex engine for every char.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Consistent Error Messages:**\n",
      "   - You check both `isinstance(req.password, str)` and `len(req.password) == 0`. FastAPI with Pydantic will already validate the type, so you can focus only on non-emptiness:\n",
      "\n",

      "       raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=\"Password is required and cannot be empty\")\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",

      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Edge Cases and Security:**\n",
      "   - Consider a max length check (e.g., 1024 chars) to avoid wasting resources with very long passwords:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",

Here’s a structured review with suggestions:\\n\\n**1. Correctness**\\n\\n- The logic for identifying character classes and calculating scores according to requirements is solid.\\n- Complexity labeling and summary generation match the product plan.\\n- Error handling covers empty passwords.\\n\\n**2. Code Style & Best Practices**\\n\\n- Code is readable, separated into logical blocks, and uses FastAPI paradigms well.\\n- Strong use of type hints, pydantic models.\\n- Response model matches expectations.\\n\\n**Suggestions**\\n\\n1. **Only Suggest Improvements When Needed:**\\n   - Per requirements, summary should only appear if not “Strong.” Your code includes `\"Very Strong\"` as well. If by spec, “Very Strong” doesn’t need suggestions, adjust the condition:\\n\\n   ```python\\n   if complexity_label not in (\"Strong\", \"Very Strong\"):\\n       ...\\n   ```\\n   If you only want to show suggestions for below “Strong”, use:\\n\\n   ```python\\n   if complexity_label != \"Strong\":\\n       ...\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Regex Efficiency:**\\n   - For long passwords, using `str.any()` may be slightly faster and more readable:\\n\\n   ```python\\n   has_uppercase = any(c.isupper() for c in password)\\n   has_lowercase = any(c.islower() for c in password)\\n   has_number = any(c.isdigit() for c in password)\\n   has_symbol = any(not c.isalnum() for c in password)\\n   ```\\n   It’s a minor optimization, but avoids regex engine for every char.\\n\\n3. **Consistent Error Messages:**\\n   - You check both `isinstance(req.password, str)` and `len(req.password) == 0`. FastAPI with Pydantic will already validate the type, so you can focus only on non-emptiness:\\n\\n   ```python\\n   if not req.password:\\n       raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=\"Password is required and cannot be empty\")\\n   ```\\n\\n4. **Docstrings and API Tags (Optional, Good Practice):**\\n   - Add docstrings to your endpoint for Swagger docs:\\n\\n   ```python\\n   @app.post(\"/password/complexity\", response_model=ComplexityResponse, tags=[\"Password\"])\\n   async def password_complexity(req: PasswordRequest):\\n       \"\"\"\\n       Analyze password complexity based on length and character variety.\\n       \"\"\"\\n       ...\\n   ```\\n\\n5. **Edge Cases and Security:**\\n   - Consider a max length check (e.g., 1024 chars) to avoid wasting resources with very long passwords:\\n\\n   ```python\\n   MAX_PWD_LEN = 1024\\n   if len(req.password) > MAX_PWD_LEN:\\n       raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=\"Password too long\")\\n   ```\\n\\n6. **Testing:**\\n   - Add unittests (not shown here) covering empty, max length, and all four char class combinations.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example with Suggestions 2 & 3 Applied:**\\n\\n```python\\ndef calculate_complexity(password: str):\\n    length = len(password)\\n    has_uppercase = any(c.isupper() for c in password)\\n    has_lowercase = any(c.islower() for c in password)\\n    has_number = any(c.isdigit() for c in password)\\n    has_symbol = any(not c.isalnum() for c in password)\\n    # ... rest unchanged\\n```\\n\\n**Summary**  \\nThis is a robust feature implementation.

You learned how the plan-and-execute model can lead to more structured and reliable code generation, and you used AutoGen to simulate a collaborative team of AI agents that can plan, code, and review work. These foundational patterns are the building blocks for creating highly sophisticated and autonomous AI systems.\n",

This division of labor, whether in a sequential 'plan-and-execute' pattern or a collaborative conversation, often leads to higher quality and more reliable results."
