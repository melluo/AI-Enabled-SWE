    "# Day 7 - Lab 2: Agent Interoperability with A2A Protocol\n\n",
    "**Objective:** To provide students with hands-on experience implementing the A2A Protocol, enabling them to build two distinct agents that can discover and communicate with each other in a standardized way.\n\n",
    "**Estimated Time:** 135 minutes\n\n",
    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "For agents to collaborate effectively without human intervention, they need a shared languageâ€”a standard protocol. The Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol provides this standard, allowing agents to discover each other's capabilities and communicate securely. In this lab, you will build two separate agents: a 'Responder' that offers a service and a 'Requester' that consumes it. Finally, you will integrate this communication into a high-level LangChain agent, bridging the gap between low-level protocols and agentic reasoning.\n\n",
    "For definitions of key terms used in this lab, please refer to the [GLOSSARY.md](../../GLOSSARY.md)."

    "## Step 1: Setup\n\n",
    "We will install the `a2a-protocol` library. This lab is unique because it requires running two separate Python scripts simultaneously. You will need to run the Responder agent in one terminal and the Requester agent in another.\n\n",
    "**Model Selection:**\n",
    "For the final challenge, where we integrate A2A into a LangChain agent, a model with strong tool-using capabilities like `gpt-4.1`, `o3`, or `gemini-2.5-pro` is recommended."

    "**Task:** Bridge the gap between the low-level A2A protocol and a high-level reasoning agent by wrapping the A2A client in a LangChain tool.\n\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "1.  Import the necessary LangChain components (`@tool`, `AgentExecutor`, etc.).\n",
    "2.  Define a new function, `get_task_complexity`, that takes `steps` and `priority` as arguments.\n",

    "Excellent work! You have successfully implemented the Agent2Agent protocol, creating two distinct agents that can communicate in a standardized way. More importantly, you integrated this low-level communication into a high-level LangChain agent, demonstrating how specialized, protocol-driven agents can be exposed as tools for more general-purpose reasoning agents. This is a key architectural pattern for building complex, interoperable multi-agent systems."
