    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "A powerful use case for AI agents is interacting with local development environments. In this lab, you will build a simplified Docker Compose agent. It will have tools to read files from your local disk and use its reasoning ability to answer questions about your Docker setup. This is a practical example of how agents can become useful developer assistants."

    "\n",
    "This lab demonstrates a profound concept in agentic AI: giving an agent the ability to interact with its **local environment**. While web search is powerful, agents that can read, write, and execute files on your machine are true developer assistants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the possibilities:\n",
    "- An agent that can read your entire codebase to answer questions about how different modules interact.\n",
    "- An agent that can write new files (like boilerplate code or test cases) directly into your project.\n",
    "- An agent that can execute shell commands to run your test suite or start a development server.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tools you are building in this lab (`list_compose_files` and `read_compose_file`) are the first simple steps toward this advanced capability. The key is to create well-defined, safe functions that provide a secure bridge between the LLM's reasoning and your file system."

    "- **Good:** `\"Lists all Docker Compose YAML files in the current directory.\"` This is clear and specific.\n",

This lab demonstrates how easily you can extend an agent's capabilities by giving it custom tools, allowing it to perform tasks far beyond simple text generation. You could imagine extending this agent with tools to run `docker-compose up` or `docker-compose down`, turning it into a fully functional DevOps assistant."
