Provide the `buggy_code` again and instruct the LLM to write a specific `pytest` test function named `test_calculate_total_with_discount` that will *fail* because of the bug. The test should use sample data and assert the correct, expected total.\n",

This process\u2014identifying a bug, writing a test to prove it exists, and then fixing the code to make the test pass\u2014is a highly effective way to systematically improve code quality and prevent regressions. This is a skill you can apply to any codebase."
