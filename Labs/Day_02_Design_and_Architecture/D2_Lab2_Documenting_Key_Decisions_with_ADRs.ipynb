    "# Day 2 - Lab 2: Documenting Key Decisions with ADRs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Use an LLM as a research assistant to compare technical options and synthesize the findings into a formal, version-controlled Architectural Decision Record (ADR).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated Time:** 60 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "Great architectural decisions are based on research and trade-offs. A critical practice for healthy, long-lived projects is documenting *why* these decisions were made. In this lab, you will use an LLM to research a key technical choice for our application and then generate a formal ADR to record that decision for the future.\n",

    "- `load_artifact()`: To read the ADR template.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "1.  Write a prompt that asks the LLM to generate a markdown template for an Architectural Decision Record.\n",
    "2.  The template should include sections for: `Title`, `Status` (e.g., Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated), `Context` (the problem or forces at play), `Decision` (the chosen solution), and `Consequences` (the positive and negative results of the decision).\n",

    "2.  Ask it to compare and contrast two technical options: **\"Using PostgreSQL with the `pgvector` extension\"** versus **\"Using a specialized vector database like ChromaDB or FAISS\"**.\n",

    "Well done! You have used an LLM to automate a complex but critical part of the architectural process. You leveraged its vast knowledge base for research and then used it again for synthesis, turning raw analysis into a formal, structured document. This `adr_001_database_choice.md` file now serves as a permanent, valuable record for anyone who works on this project in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Key Takeaway:** The pattern of **Research -> Synthesize -> Format** is a powerful workflow. You can use an LLM to gather unstructured information and then use it again to pour that information into a structured template, creating high-quality, consistent documentation with minimal effort."
