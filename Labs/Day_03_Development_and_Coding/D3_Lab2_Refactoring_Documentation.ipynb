    "Well done! You have used an LLM to perform two of the most valuable code quality tasks: refactoring and documentation. You've seen how AI can help transform messy code into a clean, maintainable structure and how it can generate comprehensive documentation from high-level project artifacts and source code. These skills are a massive productivity multiplier for any development team.\n",

Providing a clear 'before' state (the bad code) and a clear goal (the refactoring principles) allows the AI to perform complex code transformation and documentation tasks efficiently."
