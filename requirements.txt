### Notes:

- Comments are added after `#` for each package, which is supported by pip.
- All versions are the latest stable as of June 2024.
- If you don't use `python-dotenv` or `httpx`, you may remove those lines.
- `sqlite3` is included in Python's standard library, so no extra package is needed for SQLite support with SQLAlchemy.
