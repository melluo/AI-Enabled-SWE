# Title: [A short, descriptive title for the decision]

**Status:** [Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
- [Describe the problem, the driving forces, and the constraints.]

## Decision
- [State the chosen solution clearly and concisely.]

## Consequences
- [List the positive outcomes, negative trade-offs, and any future work required.]
```

### Usage Guidelines:
- Ensure the **Title** is specific enough to identify the decision at a glance.
- **Status** should reflect the current state of the decision, updating it as necessary throughout the decision's lifecycle.
- In the **Context** section, provide enough background information for someone unfamiliar with the situation to understand why this decision is necessary.
- The **Decision** section should be straightforward, detailing the exact course of action chosen.
- Use the **Consequences** section to outline both the expected benefits and potential drawbacks, as well as any additional steps that may be required after implementation.
